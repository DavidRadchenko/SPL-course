 
In this assignment we implemented a card game called Reviot in C++. The objective of this assignment was to design an object-oriented system and gain implementation experience in C++ while using classes, standard data structures and unique C++ properties such as the “Rule of 5”, learning how to handle memory in C++ and avoid memory leaks.
